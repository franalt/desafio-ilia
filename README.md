# Ília - Desafio Técnico

## Solution

To start the server run `npm run start`
To run the API tests run `npm run test`

Enviroment variables should be saved in a `.env` file, an example of this file is located at `env.example`. However no variables are required in order to run the project or its tests.

If no `DATABASE_URI` is provided a temporary in-memory mongodb instance is created.
